Under her leadership as the company’s first Chief People Officer, Home Point will continue to scale toward becoming one of the nation’s Top-10 overall mortgage lenders by continuing to enhance its people-focused initiatives – as a great workplace and a top service provider to its mortgage broker and correspondent partners.

"Home Point is experiencing tremendous growth thanks to the hard work our Associates put in every day,” said Willie Newman, President and CEO of Home Point Financial. "We will continue to make our Associates the focal point of everything we do, and Kristin meshes incredibly well with our 'We Care' mindset. She brings decades of broad-based experience that will help enhance our company’s focus on our most important asset."

Supancich joins Home Point after serving as Senior Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer at Kelly Services, a Fortune 500 company based in Troy, Michigan that specializes in workforce management solutions for employers worldwide. She led numerous parts of the organization throughout her 17 years at Kelly, combining years of operational, sales, service and human resources experience. At Home Point, she will be responsible for driving the company's initiatives related to culture, engagement, leadership development, recruiting, and diversity and inclusion.

"I am thrilled to be joining Home Point, especially during such a transformational time of growth for the company,” said Supancich. From the first conversations I had with the leadership team, I was drawn in by their passion to care for not only our Associates, but the communities, partners and customers we serve. Being part of an organization that prioritizes its people and has a purpose beyond a transaction is essential to me. I look forward to being an integral part of Home Point’s success by helping people throughout America secure the home of their dreams while achieving financial stability.”
