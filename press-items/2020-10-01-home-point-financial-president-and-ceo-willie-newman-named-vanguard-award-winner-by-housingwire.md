**ANN ARBOR, MI, October 1, 2020** — Home Point Financial, one of the nation's leading mortgage lenders and servicers, today announced its President and CEO, Willie Newman, has been named a 2020 Vanguard Award winner by HousingWire. This recognition honors executives in the housing industry for their outstanding leadership and drive to make the housing industry a better place. HousingWire is the leading source of news and information for the U.S. mortgage and housing markets.

"Part of my leadership philosophy is that you’re only as good as your team," said Newman. "I'm incredibly fortunate to work with some of the most talented people in the industry, and I share this Vanguard Award with all Home Point Associates who have contributed to our achievements and rapid growth over the years."

A two-time Vanguard Award recipient, Newman is an acknowledged expert and innovator in the mortgage industry with over 25 years of experience. Under Newman’s leadership, Home Point Financial has rapidly scaled to become a top 20 non-bank originator and servicer in just five years. He’s developed Home Point’s people-centered operating philosophy “We Care,” and is dedicated to the company’s mission to create financially healthy, happy homeowners.

Newman is committed to driving innovation and change in the housing industry, most recently spearheading the launch of Home Point’s charitable community foundation, dedicating an initial \$1 million to funding 50 new minority and female-owned mortgage brokerages throughout the nation.

HousingWire named Newman a 2020 Vanguard Award winner among other executives for their "vital contributions to their companies and the dynamic way they are changing the industry."
