## Understanding Your Mortgage Statement

Homepoint’s statements provide you with up-to-date information about your loan and serve as a convenient reminder of when your next mortgage payment is due. You will receive a paper statement monthly. Alternatively, if you have signed up for our electronic billing program, these statements will be located in your account at my.hpfc.com.

In order to better understand all of the components of your statement, we have highlighted a couple of important areas for you to take note of:

1) **Contact info.** Our customer service phone number and email address for any questions you may have.

2) **Payment due date and amount due.** This section will include fees and charges. Further details will be laid out in section (4) “Explanation of amount due.”

3) **Account information.** This includes your current interest rate and loan balances as of the statement date.

4) **Explanation of amount due.** Here is where you can find a detailed summary of the amount due.

5) **Past payments breakdown.** This section gives a detailed summary of how payments received both last period and in the past year have been applied to your account.

6) **Important messages.** Here you will find special offers and helpful information concerning your loan.

7) **Transaction activity.** This is a detailed record of all transactions since your last statement.

8) **Housing counselor information.** This section provides contact information in the event you may need to reach a housing counselor.

9) **Payment coupon.** In order to make a mortgage payment, simply detach the payment coupon at the bottom of the statement and include your check or money order in the enclosed envelope.

10) **Additional fund information.** Please indicate in the space provided if additional funds are included and how those funds should be applied to your mortgage. Please note you must submit a full contractual payment to advance your due date. Home Point does not offer a weekly payment option.

The reverse side of your printed mortgage statement, or the second page of your digital statement (not pictured here) provides additional important information including a designated address for Borrower Requests/Issue Resolution and information requests.
