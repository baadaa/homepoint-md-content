Welcome to the Homepoint family! We are so glad you’re here. We are with you every step of the way on the road to a financially happy, healthy homeownership. At Homepoint, we put homeowners first, because we believe that our business prospers when our customers thrive.

## What next?

In the coming weeks you will receive a “Welcome Email” in your inbox, and a “Welcome Letter” in the mail. Both include important information about registering your account, making payments with HomePoint, and other relevant legal disclosures.

## Our Homeownership Platform

You may want to register your account online. We’ve created an online portal that allows you to review details of your loan 24/7, schedule mortgage payments, access escrow details, and view statements. Register at my.hpfc.com [hyperlink: my.hpfc.com] to gain access to our full services, built for you!

## Mobile Application

To make your homeownership experience even more convenient, we’ve built a mobile application on both the Apple App Store [hyperlink] and the Google Play Store [hyperlink]. The app gives you access to:

- Manage your payments, bank account information and autopay
- View payment history and current interest rate
- Information regarding programs available to lower your monthly mortgage payment

## E-bill

Our electronic-billing program is great for those who prefer easy convenient access to their statements online. This program reduces our paper waste by opting-in to electronic communication including, periodic account statements, monthly mortgage statements, disclosures, privacy notices, agreements, changes to terms and conditions, fee schedules, and other documents. Sign up in one-click by logging in at my.hpfc.com [hyperlink] and going to “settings.”

## AutoPay

You can make automatic payments by setting up AutoPay at my.hpfc.com [hyperlink] and clicking “Make a payment.” This will automatically debit your monthly payment from your debit card or bank account on the date you choose. To start making automatic payments, turn on AutoPay at least 24 hours before your next payment is due. Otherwise, your next payment won’t be automatically debited.

## Resource Center

Our Homeowners Resource Center [hyperlink to homeowners resource center on corporate website] has a lot of important information and resources that you may find useful as you begin your journey as a homeowner. Check it out as we will frequently be updating the page with new information and educational material.
