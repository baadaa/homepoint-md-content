# What is a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)?

A HELOC or, Home Equity Line of Credit, is a line of credit that is secured by the equity of your home. A HELOC works well due to its low interest rate, and freedom to choose what the money is used for. You can use this loan to make a big purchase, consolidate your debt, or even renovate your home. Did you know that the interest you pay on a HELOC used when renovating your home is likely to be tax-deductible? Not only that, but you can actively raise the value of your home, borrowing from the value of your home!

## The Home Point HELOC

Applying for a Home Point HELOC can be done completely online, in as little as 5 minutes, and you can be approved in only 5 days. You can borrow between $15,000 and $150,000**, just using your house as collateral. HELOCs have a much lower interest rate than credit cards and personal loans, in fact, Home Point’s HELOC comes with a fixed APR of as low as 5.49%\***, so you won’t have to worry about the amount you owe skyrocketing.

While one of the ways to use a HELOC may be to renovate your home, it can be utilized for consolidating debt or even making a necessary large purchase. It’s not in your best interest to use a HELOC if you believe you will be unable to pay the amount of the loan you borrow, because your home will be foreclosed on.

Although the application takes only minutes, the approval process will take about 5 days.\* Many lenders will require a minimum of 20% equity in your home, as well as a good credit score and low DTI (debt-to-income ratio).

Disclaimer:

\*5 minutes is the average time from submission to approval. Funds can be dispersed within 5 days in counties that accept e-recording and e-signatures. Pre-qualification does not affect your credit score.
\*\*Our loan amounts range from a minimum of $15,000 to a maximum of $250,000. Your maximum loan amount may be lower than \$250,000 and will ultimately depend on your home value and equity at the time of application. We determine home value and resulting equity through independent data sources and automated valuation models.
\*\*\*APRs start at 5.49% for the most qualified applicants and are higher for other applicants. For example, for a borrower with a CLTV of 45% and a credit score of 800, a five-year Home Point Home Equity Line with an initial draw amount of $50,000 would have a fixed annual percentage rate (APR) of 5.49% and a 4.99% origination fee. Your total loan amount would be $52,495. You will be responsible for an origination fee of up to 4.99% of your initial draw, depending on the state where your property is located. The advertised rate is only available to borrowers using primary residences as collateral. Your actual rate will depend on many factors such as your credit, combined loan to value ratio, loan term and occupancy status. The advertised rate of 5.49% includes a discount for enrolling in autopay (0.25%). APRs start at 5.74% for customers that do not opt into autopay. Property insurance is required as a condition of the loan and flood insurance may be required if your property is located in a flood zone.
