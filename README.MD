# Homepoint website 12/2 launch content

- Due to tight due date, the initial launch will only be statically built without being hooked up to the CMS backend.

- Certain sections of the site, however, consist of _collection of items_ and can use standardized flatfiles as content source, rather than each text block manually being copy-pasted into JSX.

- Once the site launches and WordPress backend is connected, this repo can stop being updated.
